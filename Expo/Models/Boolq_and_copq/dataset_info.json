  "description": "SuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after\nGLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved\nresources, and a new public leaderboard.\n\nBoolQ (Boolean Questions, Clark et al., 2019a) is a QA task where each example consists of a short\npassage and a yes/no question about the passage. The questions are provided anonymously and\nunsolicited by users of the Google search engine, and afterwards paired with a paragraph from a\nWikipedia article containing the answer. Following the original work, we evaluate with accuracy.\n\nSuperGLUE (https://super.gluebenchmark.com/) is a new benchmark styled after\nGLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved\nresources, and a new public leaderboard.\n\nThe Choice Of Plausible Alternatives (COPA, Roemmele et al., 2011) dataset is a causal\nreasoning task in which a system is given a premise sentence and two possible alternatives. The\nsystem must choose the alternative which has the more plausible causal relationship with the premise.\nThe method used for the construction of the alternatives ensures that the task requires causal reasoning\nto solve. Examples either deal with alternative possible causes or alternative possible effects of the\npremise sentence, accompanied by a simple question disambiguating between the two instance\ntypes for the model. All examples are handcrafted and focus on topics from online blogs and a\nphotography-related encyclopedia. Following the recommendation of the authors, we evaluate using\naccuracy.",
